# Project - Web Programming with Ruby

:star: Remember to gather PDA evidence :star:

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

All of these will be covered later in the course. Do not make any attempt to use them this week, even if you've used them before.

Make lots of little (but sensible!) git commits. The number of commits in your final submission is one of the criteria your work will be judged on.

## Briefs

These briefs detail what is expected of you, including an MVP. Note that the MVP is the **Minimum** Viable Product. You are strongly encouraged to go beyond these specifications, and some possible extensions are provided.

Talk through your ideas with an instructor during the planning process, and before you begin coding.

### Spending Tracker

Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.

#### MVP

* The app should allow the user to create and edit merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
* The app should allow the user to create and edit tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
* The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.

#### Inspired by:

Monzo, MoneyDashboard, lots of mobile/online banking apps

#### Possible Extensions

* The user should be able to mark Merchants and Tags as deactivated. Users will not be able to choose deactivated merchants/tags when creating a transaction. 
* Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.
* The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.
* The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.


### Shop Inventory

Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.

#### MVP

* The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.
* The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.
* The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately.
  * This might mean that it makes more sense for a car shop to track makes and models of cars. Or a bookstore might sell books by author, or by publisher, and not by manufacturer. You are free to name classes and tables as appropriate to your project.
* Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.
* As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.

#### Inspired by

eBay, Amazon (back end only), Magento

#### Possible Extensions

* Calculate the markup on items in the store, and display it in the inventory
* Filter the inventory list by manufacturer. For example, provide an option to view all books in stock by a certain author.
* Categorise your items. Books might be categorised by genre (crime, horror, romance...) and cars might be categorised by type (SUV, coupé, hatchback...). Provide an option to filter the inventory list by these categories.
* Mark manufacturers as active/deactivated. Deactivated manufacturers will not appear when creating new products.

### Vet Management App

A veterinary practice has approached you to build a web application to help them manage their animals and vets. A vet may look after many animals at a time. An animal is registered with only one vet.

#### MVP

- The practice wants to be able to register / track animals. Important information for the vets to know is -
  - Name
  - Date Of Birth (use a VARCHAR initially)
  - Type of animal
  - Contact details for the owner
  - Treatment notes
- Be able to assign animals to vets
- CRUD actions for vets / animals - remember the user - what would they want to see on each View? What Views should there be?

#### Possible Extensions

- Mark owners as being registered/unregistered with the Vet. unregistered owners won't be able to add any more animals.
- If an owner has multiple animals we don't want to keep updating contact details separately for each pet. Extend your application to reflect that an owner can have many pets and to more sensibly keep track of owners' details (avoiding repetition / inconsistencies)
- Handle check-in / check-out dates
- Let the practice see all animals currently in the practice (today's date is between the check-in and check-out?)
- Sometimes an owner does not know the DOB. Allow them to enter an age instead. Try and make sure this always up to date - ie if they visit again a year from now a 3 yr old dog is now 4.
- Add extra functionality of your choosing - assigning treatments, a more comprehensive way of maintaining treatment notes over time. Appointments. Pricing / billing.

### Gym

A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

#### MVP

- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Members
- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Classes
- The app should allow the gym to book members on specific classes
- The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
- The app should show all members that are booked in for a particular class

#### Inspired By

[Glofox](https://www.glofox.com/club-solution/), [Pike13](https://www.pike13.com/pike13-scheduling-software-demo)

#### Possible Extensions

- Classes could have a maximum capacity, and users can only be added while there is space remaining.
- The gym could be able to give its members Premium or Standard membership. Standard members can only be signed up for classes during off-peak hours.
- The Gym could mark members and classes as active/deactivated. Deactivated members/classes will not appear when creating bookings. 

### Travel Bucket List

Build an app to track someone's travel adventures.

#### MVP:

 * The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
 * The user should be able to create and edit countries
 * Each country should have one or more cities to visit
 * The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities
 * The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see

#### Possible Extensions:

 * Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit
 * Add sights to the destination cities
 * Search for destination by continent, city or country
 * Any other ideas you might come up with


## Submission

Submit a link to your Github repo through the Homework Submission form as soon as the repo has been created.

Your code will be reviewed with an instructor on Wednesday afternoon.

## Presentation

Presentations will be held on Friday. You will have 10 minutes to present your work, with 5 minutes for questions.

We expect you to:

* Show your sketches, notes, diagrams, wireframes and user planning
* Demonstrate your app's functionality
* Talk about some code that you are particularly proud of
* Highlight your main learning points

Do not:

* Talk through every single line of code
* Go over the time limit

## Asking for help

The instructional team will be on hand for technical assistance, but you are strongly encouraged to take this opportunity to practise self-sufficiency, as will be expected of you as a professional software developer.

Remember to use the 4 Bs (in this order):

- **B**rain  (think about it)
- **B**ook   (research the problem e.g. Google)
- **B**uddy  (your classmates)
- **B**oss   (the instructors)

Before asking an instructor for help this week, you should be ready to answer the following questions:

* What are you trying to achieve?
* What do you think the problem is?
* What have you tried so far?
* What did Google say about your error message?
